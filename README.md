# Calculating-Excess-M1-Balances-by-Deflating-M1-by-Consumer-Price-Indices
Excess M1 balances: Determined by deflating M1 (IFS line 34) by consumer prices (IFS line 64) and then subtracting an estimated demand for money from it. The demand for money, in turn, is estimated from a regression of real M1 balances on real GDP, consumer price inflation, and a linear time trend.
